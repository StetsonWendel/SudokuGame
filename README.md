# Overview

Attempt to code Sudoku in C++. Chance to learn and get better at C++.

A rough working version of Sudoku as played in planes and newspapers. 

This was a chance to lean C++ and become passingly familier with the language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
